Following the Guillermo Rauch approach, I tried to create a website similar to his work using Flutter. 

All you need to do is:

- Modify the data in the file "lib/config/setting/cv_data.dart."
- Change the avatar image to "assets/images/avatar.jpg."
- Update the website name in "lib/config/setting/app_setting.dart."
- Run flutter build web.
- Deploy the project.
